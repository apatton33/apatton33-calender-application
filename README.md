# apatton33-calender-application

## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to modify an application that saves events for each hour.
    It needed the current date added to the top of the page.
    It needed time blocks for the business hours through the day.
    It presents them in past, present, and future.
    I can enter and event into the block and save it.
    If you refresh the page it showed it stored until deleted and saved again.
    

## Usage
    I can enter and event into the block and save it.
    If you refresh the page it showed it stored until deleted and saved again.
